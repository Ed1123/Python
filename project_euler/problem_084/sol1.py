Project Euler Problem 84: https://projecteuler.net/problem=84
Monopoly odds

Main idea:
Players start at GO (position 0).
Do n turns.
The probability of a given square is the count on the squares array divided by n.

Turn starts.
Player roll the dice(s).
Player moves to current_position + dices_result.
If double (dices[0] == dices[1]) count. If it is the third double go to jail and end
the turn.
If new current_position is a CC (2, 17, 33) or CH (7, 22, 36) square, then "pick" a CC
or CH card and perform its action. Going to jail ends turn.
End of turn.

For choosing a card from CC or CH use a queue. When "picking" a card dequeue it,
perform it's action, and enqueue it again on the queue.

When ending the turn count the ending position in the squares array
(squares[current_position] += 1).
